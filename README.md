VirtualSMC
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC) [![Scan Status](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/16571/badge.svg?flat=1)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/16571)

Advanced Apple SMC emulator in the kernel. Requires [Lilu](https://github.com/vit9696/Lilu) for full functioning.

#### Features
- Supports macOS 10.8 and newer (10.9 and newer is recommended)
- Implements MMIO protocol and interrupt-based responses for compatibility with modern OS
- Properly reports key attributes and r/w protection in the keys
- Allows tuning on per-model basis and allows to use different SMC generations
- Extensible by the plugins for sensor and key addition support
- Enables `smcdebug=XX` boot argument support on 10.9
- Replaces hardware SMC it finds (to disable SMC entirely you need to flash a dedicated firmware)

#### Boot arguments
- Add `-vsmcdbg` to enable debug printing (available in DEBUG binaries).
- Add `-vsmcoff` to switch off all the Lilu enhancements.
- Add `-vsmcbeta` to enable Lilu enhancements on unsupported OS (10.16 and below are enabled by default).
- Add `-vsmcrpt` to report about missing SMC keys to the system log.
- Add `-vsmccomp` to prefer existing hardware SMC implementation if found.
- Add `vsmcgen=X` to force exposing X-gen SMC device (1 and 2 are supported).
- Add `vsmchbkp=X` to set HBKP dumping mode (0 - off, 1 - normal, 2 - without encryption).
- Add `vsmcslvl=X` to set value serialisation level (0 - off, 1 - normal, 2 - with sensitive data (default)).
- Add `smcdebug=0xff` to enable AppleSMC debug information printing.
- Add `watchdog=0` to disable WatchDog timer (if you get accidental reboots).
